# Star_Wars_Project

A Sparta Global Data Engineering 401 mini project to pull data on all available starships from the API. The "pilots" key contains URLs pointing to the characters who pilot the starship. This will be used to replace 'pilots' with a list of ObjectIDs from the characters collection in MongoDB, then the starships will be inserted into their own collection.
